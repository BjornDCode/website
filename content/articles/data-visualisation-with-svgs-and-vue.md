Recently I've been playing around with manipulating SVG's directly with Vue. This resulted in a project where I visualise some data related to air travel on a world map.
This was great because it allowed me to generate SVG elements like lines or path dynamically. I also decided to add some animations to the generated elements.

Originally I wanted to fetch data directly from an API, but I wasn't able to find a solid, reliable service with all the data I wanted. Instead I grabbed some data from Wikipedia and put it into JSON files which are then fetched in the project.
