For a while now I've been thinking about process of building websites. A lot of projects I've been a part of has consisted of some form of 'page builder' where clients can build up pages of content from pre-made blocks. There are countless variations of this. Wordpress has Gutenberg and Advanced Custom Fields. Shopify has created their own system. Drupal, Umbraco and many more has a similar version of this.

There are also services that make it possible to create an entire website without touching any code. Examples of these are Webflow, Carrd and Grid.studio. My initial though about a tool like Webflow is that it doesn't make it much easier to build websites. Sure, it removes the need to write code by hand, but it still requires knowledge of the web primitives such as CSS.

I'm gonna make a series of small prototypes that will address some of the problems the existing tools suffer from. The goal isn't really to build a new product or service. It's more about figuring out if there is a better solution. Or if it's an inherently complex system that is very hard to build well.

I wanna do this because I've personally had some terrible experiences working with CMS's like Umbraco and Drupal. I can't help to think that there must be better ways to do it.

GrapesJS seems to be the most similar to my idea for this concept. I think it has a couple of fundamental flaws though. I think the level of detail you can customise for each block is too high. In my vision a block is a well designed component by a designer with only a few small customisation options.

I'm not sure what will come out of this experiment but my plan is to release updates along the way with prototypes that tries to solve some of these problems.
