The web community seems to be deeply divided on whether using frontend frameworks like Vue or React is a good idea. Many people feel it's overkill while others think it's a necessity to create sophisticated apps in 2020. I think it's possible to take a step back and have a different look at these libraries.

React is described as a view library. And it, along other similar frontend frameworks, excels at that. Using Vue, React or any similar library isn't the same as deciding to create a full single page application.

My personal favourite tool is Vue. And it's not only good at handling interactive elements on a website. It's a great tool for templating.

With the rise of view libraries, advanced patterns for handling front end components have also come to light. Creating small components following the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology or encapsulating logic using [renderless components](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/) are just a few of them.

I'm sure these patterns could be somewhat replicated with a regular templating engine.

But with the birth of [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/), you don't have to decide whether a component should be Blade or Vue. You create all UI elements using the same paradigm and in turn you have a simpler app in the end.
