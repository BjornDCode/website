Radix UI provides a number of unstyled, accessible UI components for React projects.

Radix is great because it takes care of a lot of the hard things like setting aria attributes, managing state, controlling keyboard interactions and more.

The biggest benefit is that the elements are unstyled. That means I can bring my own styles and the elements will fit my projects existing design.
