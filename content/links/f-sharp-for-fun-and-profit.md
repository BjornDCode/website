A blog about functional programming and specifically F#.

I don't have any particular interest in F# itself but I'm interested in other functional programming languages. And Scott Wlashin does a great job of explaining the fundamental concepts of functional programming.

He also has a number of good talks on the subject and he's written one of my favorite books: [Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/books/)
