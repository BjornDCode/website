React Aria is a collection of React hooks for building accessible user interfaces.

There's some overlap with [Radix](/links/radix-ui) in that it can help create accessible UI elements. But React Aria supports more elements than Radix and the Date/Time helpers for building date pickers seem particularly promising.

It's built by Adobe so I feel comfortable betting on it as a library that will stay maintained.
